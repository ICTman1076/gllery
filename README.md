# gllery - The PHP gallery with photographers in mind.
gllery is an open-source and free to use PHP software to upload to a PHP-compatible server (gllery is designed for 7.0.22)
which allows them to easily share, provide downloads and even license to people! :)

This repo contains gllery's core - it does not provide an interface. Another repo to cover that is to come.

There's not much else really. Contributions will currently be rejected as we get off the ground. **We do not recommend you download gllery yet, as it won't work.**
